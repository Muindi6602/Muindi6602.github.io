  Sometimes I wonder how someone I haven’t met yet can make me feel so alive, <br><br>so hopeful, and so loved. But then I remember that love isn’t about proximity<br>it’s about connection. <br><br>And you, Ednah, have connected with me in ways I never thought possible.<br><br> As John Green said, ‘I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.’ That’s exactly how it happened with you. <br>Slowly, through every word and every shared moment, and then all at once, <br>I realized I couldn’t imagine my life without you.
